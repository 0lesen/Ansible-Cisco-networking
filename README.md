# Ansible-Cisco-networking
<p>This was a small project that was created, when trying to automate Cisco networking.

The project is based on ansible software for automation.




This Ansible project contains roles that configure Cisco devices, based on information defined in host files.


Playbooks can contain deferent roles based on what to configure.


I have predefined some playbooks that can be used to seperate configurations.
# cisco_all_roles.yml
# cisco_add_vlans.yml
# cisco_base_msw.yml
# cisco_base_interfaces.yml
# cisco_base_routing.yml
